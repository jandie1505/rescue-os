# Rescue OS
Rescue OS is a debian live-build configuration for a rescue OS that runs from RAM. 

It's currently work in progress and might not work as expected.

## Download

You can download pre-built ISOs from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jandie1505/rescue-os/releases/latest).  
They are automatically built every 2 months with the newest available packages.

## Installation

You can flash the ISO to a USB drive using `sudo dd if=live-image-amd64.hybrid.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M oflag=sync status=progress && sync` or a tool like Balena Etcher.

## How to build

1. Clone a repo on a system running [Debian 13 (Trixie)](https://www.debian.org/distrib/).  
   If you don't use debian on your computer, you can create a Debian VM using QEMU/KVM or VirtualBox.
3. Run `./build.sh`.  
   The script only works if `sudo` is available and the current user has root access.
5. The final iso image is generated at `PROJECT_DIR/live-build/live-image-amd64.hybrid.iso`
